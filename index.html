        <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Bastion, and I started cubing in 2020. I'm currently a high school student in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and if you can't already tell, I love cubing! It has helped me through so many troubling times. I'm currently sitting on a 13.634 second PR, looking to break it in the coming months. I competed for the first time in July 2024 at the Minnesota Warm-Up, and have only been getting faster. I've also taught lots of people how to solve a cube, and they've greatly appreciated it. If you want to get into cubing, but don't know where to start, I made a tutorial in February 2024 on how to solve your first cube! Check it out here:  <h2> <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02vD6QRTBH0>The Rubiks Cube - An Easy Tutorial</a></h2>
